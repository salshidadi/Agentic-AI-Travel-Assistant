`# Phase 1: Problem Understanding and Data Exploration

This notebook serves as the first deliverable for the SWE485 project. The goal of this phase is to define the project's objective, select and explore the datasets that will be used, and outline a plan for data preprocessing.

1. The Dataset Goal & Source
Our project requires a multifaceted understanding of the travel booking domain, from customer behavior to conversational patterns and real-world flight logistics. No single dataset can provide all this information. Therefore, we are adopting a composite dataset strategy, using multiple specialized datasets to build a comprehensive foundation for our AI model.

Our Datasets:
1- Customer Booking Behavior Dataset

Goal: To understand the patterns and preferences of travelers. This dataset contains 50,000 anonymized booking records, providing crucial insights into how far in advance people book, trip duration, and preferences for ancillary services like extra baggage or preferred seats. This data will be vital for our unsupervised learning model in Phase 3 to identify traveler personas.

2- Synthetic Airline Passenger and Flight Dataset

Goal: To augment our understanding of user behavior with more detailed passenger demographics and flight information. This synthetic dataset includes features like passenger age, income level, travel purpose, and flight satisfaction scores, which are essential for building a more personalized recommendation engine.

3- King Khalid International Airport (Riyadh) Flights Dataset

Goal: To ground our project in a realistic, local context relevant to the Saudi market. This dataset contains real flight information for arrivals and departures from Riyadh's airport. We will use it to extract authentic flight routes, destinations, and airline carriers, making our system's knowledge base more relevant and practical.

4- Hotel Booking Conversational Datasets

Goal: To understand the structure and flow of a typical booking conversation. These datasets contain dialogues between a user and a booking assistant. We will analyze these conversations to identify common user intents (e.g., book_hotel, check_price), required information (entities like destination, dates), and the assistant's questions. This will be the blueprint for our synthetic Arabic dataset in Phase 2.

`## 2. General Information

In this section, we will inspect each dataset to understand its structure, data types, and key features.

2.1 Customer Booking Behavior Dataset`

print("--- Customer Booking Behavior Dataset ---")
print("\nFirst 5 rows:")
display(df_booking.head())
print("\nDataset Info:")
df_booking.info()

`Key Features Description:    
num_passengers: The number of passengers in the booking.
sales_channel: The channel used for booking (Internet or Mobile).
purchase_lead: Number of days between the booking date and the travel date.
length_of_stay: The duration of the stay at the destination in days.
flight_day: The day of the week for the flight departure.
route: The flight route (origin and destination airport codes).
wants_extra_baggage, wants_preferred_seat, wants_in_flight_meals: Boolean flags for ancillary service preferences.
booking_complete: Our potential target variable, indicating if the booking was completed (1) or not (0).

2.2 Synthetic Airline Passenger and Flight Dataset`

print("\n--- Synthetic Airline Passenger and Flight Dataset ---")
print("\nFirst 5 rows:")
display(df_passenger.head())
print("\nDataset Info:")
df_passenger.info()

`Key Features Description:    
Airline, Departure_Airport, Arrival_Airport: Basic flight details.
Price_USD: The price of the ticket.
Age, Gender, Income_Level: Passenger demographic information.
Travel_Purpose: The reason for travel (e.g., Business, Leisure, Family).
Seat_Class: The class of the seat booked.
Booking_Days_In_Advance: Similar to purchase_lead, useful for understanding booking behavior.

2.3 King Khalid International Airport (Riyadh) Flights Dataset`

print("\n--- King Khalid International Airport (Riyadh) Flights Dataset ---")
print("\nFirst 5 rows:")
display(df_riyadh.head())
print("\nDataset Info:")
df_riyadh.info()

`Key Features Description:
flight_date: The date of the flight.
direction: Whether the flight is an 'Arrival' or 'Departure'.
time_scheduled, time_actual: Scheduled and actual times, useful for analyzing delays.
flight_number: The unique flight identifier.
airline: The name of the airline.
origin, destination: The airport codes for the flight route. This is the most valuable feature for our project, as it provides realistic routes for the Saudi market.

2.4 Hotel Booking Conversational Datasets`

print("\n--- Hotel Booking Assistant Raw Chats Dataset ---")
print("\nFirst 5 rows:")
display(df_chats.head())
print("\n--- Hotel Data (conversation2.csv) ---")
print("\nFirst 5 rows:")
display(df_hotel_data.head())

`Key Features Description:    
These datasets are text-based and capture dialogues.
The structure is typically a sequence of turns between a "user" or "human" and an "assistant" or "agent".
The content reveals the questions a user asks (their intent) and the information they provide (the entities), such as destination, dates, and number of guests.
Analyzing these conversations is crucial for designing the logic of our own conversational agent and for creating the training data for our NLU model in Phase 2.`

`## 3. Summary & Visualization (Exploratory Data Analysis)

Here, we will perform EDA to uncover initial insights from the tabular datasets.

3.1 Statistical Summary of Booking Behavior`

print("Statistical Summary of the Customer Booking Behavior Dataset:")
display(df_booking.describe())

`Initial Observations:
The average purchase_lead is about 85 days, but the standard deviation is high (90 days), and the max is 867 days. This indicates a wide range of booking behaviors.
The average length_of_stay is around 23 days, which seems quite long and might be skewed by outliers.
Most bookings are for 1-2 passengers.

3.2 Missing Value Analysis`

print("Missing values in Customer Booking Behavior dataset:")
print(df_booking.isnull().sum())
print("\nMissing values in Synthetic Passenger dataset:")
print(df_passenger.isnull().sum())
print("\nMissing values in Riyadh Flights dataset:")
# The Riyadh dataset has many missing values in time columns, which is expected for future/scheduled flights.
print(df_riyadh.isnull().sum())

`Missing Value Findings:
The customer_booking and synthetic_flight_passenger datasets are clean with no missing values, which is excellent for modeling.
The riyadh_airport_flights dataset has missing values in time_actual and status, which is logical as these fields are only populated after a flight has departed or landed. For our purposes of extracting routes, this is not an issue.

3.3 Visualizations

Visualization 1: How Do Customers Book? (Sales Channel Distribution)`

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.countplot(data=df_booking, x='sales_channel')
plt.title('Distribution of Sales Channels', fontsize=16)
plt.xlabel('Sales Channel', fontsize=12)
plt.ylabel('Number of Bookings', fontsize=12)
plt.show()

`Insight: The vast majority of bookings are made via the Internet compared to Mobile. This suggests that while a mobile presence is important, the primary user interaction happens on the web platform.

Visualization 2: How Far in Advance Do People Book?`

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 7))
sns.histplot(df_booking['purchase_lead'], bins=50, kde=True)
plt.title('Distribution of Purchase Lead Time (in days)', fontsize=16)
plt.xlabel('Days Between Booking and Travel', fontsize=12)
plt.ylabel('Frequency', fontsize=12)
plt.xlim(0, 400) # Limiting to 400 days to see the main distribution
plt.show()

`Insight: The distribution is heavily skewed to the right. A very large number of customers book their flights shortly before the travel date (less than 50 days in advance), while a smaller number plan their trips many months ahead. Our AI agent should be able to handle both last-minute and long-term planning requests.

Visualization 3: What is the Purpose of Travel?`

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 7))
sns.countplot(data=df_passenger, x='Travel_Purpose', order=df_passenger.value_counts().index)
plt.title('Distribution of Travel Purpose', fontsize=16)
plt.xlabel('Travel Purpose', fontsize=12)
plt.ylabel('Number of Passengers', fontsize=12)
plt.show()

`Insight: The travel purposes are evenly distributed across Business, Emergency, Family, and Leisure in this synthetic dataset. This is a good reminder that our agent must be able to cater to different user needs and priorities (e.g., a business traveler might prioritize direct flights, while a leisure traveler might prioritize price).

Visualization 4: Top 10 Busiest Routes from Riyadh`

# We are interested in all routes, both arrivals and departures
top_10_destinations = df_riyadh['destination'].value_counts().nlargest(10)

plt.figure(figsize=(14, 8))
sns.barplot(x=top_10_destinations.index, y=top_10_destinations.values, palette='viridis')
plt.title('Top 10 Busiest Destinations from/to Riyadh (RUH)', fontsize=16)
plt.xlabel('Destination Airport Code', fontsize=12)
plt.ylabel('Number of Flights', fontsize=12)
plt.show()

**Insight:** This chart shows the most frequent destinations connected to Riyadh. Jeddah (JED), Dammam (DMM), and Dubai (DXB) are clearly major hubs. This real-world data is invaluable for generating realistic training examples for our agent (e.g., "Book a flight from Riyadh to Jeddah").

`## 4. Preprocessing Techniques

Based on the initial exploration, we have formulated the following plan for data preprocessing, which will be implemented in the subsequent phases of the project.

1- Handling Categorical Data (Phase 2):
The flight_day column in df_booking is textual ('Mon', 'Tue', etc.). We will convert this into numerical format (e.g., 1 for Monday, 2 for Tuesday) so it can be used by machine learning models.
Other categorical columns like sales_channel, Travel_Purpose, and Seat_Class will be one-hot encoded to convert them into a numerical format suitable for modeling.

2- Feature Engineering (Phase 3):
We can create a new feature, such as is_weekend, from the flight_day column to see if weekend travel has a different pattern.
From the route column, we can extract origin and destination as separate features to analyze travel patterns more granularly.

3- Text Data Processing (Phase 2):
The conversational datasets (df_chats, df_hotel_data) will be parsed to create a structured dataset for training our Natural Language Understanding (NLU) model.
Each user utterance will be labeled with an intent (e.g., request_hotel, provide_dates).
Key pieces of information within the text will be identified and labeled as entities (e.g., "Paris" -> destination, "tomorrow" -> date).

4- Synthetic Dataset Generation (Phase 2):
The core of our data strategy will be to create a large, custom Arabic conversational dataset.
We will use the dialogue flows from the English conversational datasets as templates.
We will populate these templates with realistic entities extracted from the tabular datasets, especially the routes and airlines from the Riyadh airport dataset, to ensure local relevance. This synthetic dataset will be the primary training data for our supervised learning model.`
