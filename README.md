Project Motivation
The goal of this project is to develop a sophisticated, AI-powered travel assistant. The system is designed to function as an "advice or action-suggestion system" by helping users book flights and hotels through a conversational interface.   

Our motivation stems from the increasing demand for personalized and efficient customer service in the travel industry. Traditional booking websites can be cumbersome, and customer support often involves long wait times. By leveraging machine learning and generative AI, we aim to create an intelligent agent that can understand natural language, provide tailored recommendations, and automate the entire booking process. This project will explore supervised learning for understanding user intent, unsupervised learning to discover traveler personas, and generative AI to create a seamless, agentic conversational experience.
