    "\n",
    "**Justification**:\n",
    "1. **Utility**: In a travel booking context, users often seek specific facts (prices, times, locations) quickly. The bulleted structure of Template A minimizes cognitive load.\n",
    "2. **Mobile-Friendliness**: Structured output renders better on small screens compared to long blocks of text.\n",
    "3. **Integration**: It is easier to parse structured text programmatically if we later decide to extract entities (like hotel names) from the response.\n",
    "4. **Clarity**: By avoiding emotional language, we reduce the risk of the AI \"hallucinating\" a subjective experience (e.g., claiming a food is \"delicious\" when taste is subjective).\n",
